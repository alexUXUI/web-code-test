# Code Test for Front End Web

This code test will evaluate your abilities to develop a Single Page Application (SPA) using web technologies such as Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. 

While it is recommended that you develop this solution using AngularJs, you may choose a different Javascript framework, such as ReactJs or EmberJs. However, please bear in mind that we'd still like to see a fully working SPA solution. Therefore, your framework should have components for routing, HTTP communication and DOM manipulation.

The test consists of a partially completed solution containing static html mockups. The mockups serve as a guide for the user experience. You must turn the static mocks into a working SPA by by following the instructions below.
